# Moh-Zaman-Front-End Development Portfolio

## Description

This is my personal portfolio with all the projects I have recently worked on and will be working on. It will be updated throughout my individual learning experience.

I have always had a nack for coding and decided to take the leap into learning different web development techniques and projects. My current first project is search engine optimisations (SEO) which you can view by accessing the delopyed link of this repo.
